# Encryption-and-Decryption-Program

Unfinished encryption and decryption program that asks you to paste in data (and hopefully later on a file), in order to decode the data and match it to multiple words found in the US dictionary (easiest formatted dictionary I could find for now).
#
This so far only allows you to encypt and decrypt using ceasars cypher but I want to expand that with future updates.
#
It also critically does not do anything as I am trying to expand my skills with C and so I am new to learning memory management, file handling and just all around basics in C.
